                            Houston, Monday, July 21--Men have landed and walked on the moon.
                            Two Americans, astronauts of Apollo 11, 
                            steered their fragile four-legged lunar module safely and 
                            smoothly to the historic landing yesterday at 4:17:40 P.M., 
                            astern daylight time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Neil A. Armstrong, the 38-year-old civilian commander, 
                            radioed to earth and the mission control room here:
                            "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."
                            The first men to reach the moon--Mr. Armstrong and his co-pilot, 
                            Col. Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. of the Air Force--brought their ship to rest on a level, 
                            rock-strewn plain near the southwestern shore of the arid Sea of Tranquility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            About six and a half hours later, 
                            Mr. Armstrong opened the landing craft's hatch, 
                            stepped slowly down the ladder and 
                            declared as he planted the first human footprint on the lunar crust:
                            "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            His first step on the moon came at 10:56:20 P.M., 
                            as a television camera outside the craft transmitted his every move 
                            to an awed and excited audience of hundreds of millions of people on earth.

                            Mr. Armstrong's initial steps were tentative tests of the lunar soil's firmness 
                            and of his ability to move about easily in his bulky white spacesuit and backpacks 
                            and under the influence of lunar gravity, which is one-sixth that of the earth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "The surface is fine and powdery," the astronaut reported. 
                            "I can pick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers like 
                            powdered charcoal to the sole and sides of my boots. 
                            I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch. 
                            But I can see the footprints of my boots in the treads in the fine sandy particles.

                                It was man's first landing on another world, 
                                the realization of centuries of dreams, 
                                the fulfillment of a decade of striving,

                                if he applies his mind and resources with single-minded determination.

                                The moon, long the symbol of the impossible and the inaccessible, 
                                was now within man's reach, 
                                the first port of call in this new age of spacefaring.

                                telephoned President Nixon in Washington to report:
                                "Mr. President, it is my honor on behalf of the entire NASA team to report to you 
                                that the Eagle has landed on the Sea of Tranquility and 
                                our astronauts are safe and looking forward to starting the exploration of the moon."

                        <p>
                            During one break in the astronauts' work, P
                            resident Nixon congratulated them from the White House in what, he said, 
                            "certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made." 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Because of what you have done," the President told the astronauts, 
                            "the heavens have become a part of man's world. 
                            And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility 
                            it required us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to earth.
                            "For one priceless moment in the whole history of man all the people 
                            on this earth are truly one--one in their pride in what 
                            you have done and one in our prayers that you will return safely to earth."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mr. Armstrong replied:
                            "Thank you Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us 
                            to be here representing not only the United States but men of peace of all nations, 
                            men with interests and a curiosity and men with a vision for the future."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mr. Armstrong and Colonel Aldrin returned to their landing craft and 
                            closed the hatch at 1:12 A.M., 2 hours 21 minutes after opening the hatch on the moon. 
                            While the third member of the crew, Lieut. Col. Michael Collins of the Air Force, 
                            kept his orbital vigil overhead in the command ship, 
                            the two moon explorers settled down to sleep.
                            Outside their vehicle the astronauts had found a bleak world. 
                            It was just before dawn, with the sun low over the eastern horizon behind them and 
                            the chill of the long lunar nights still clinging to the boulders, 
                            small craters and hills before them
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Colonel Aldrin said that he could see "literally thousands of small craters" 
                            and a low hill out in the distance. 
                            But most of all he was impressed initially by the "variety of shapes, 
                            angularities, granularities" of the rocks and soil where the landing craft, 
                            code-named Eagle had set down.
                            The landing was made four miles west of the aiming point, 
                            but well within the designated area. An apparent error in some data fed 
                            into the craft's guidance computer from the earth 
                            was said to have accounted for the discrepancy.
